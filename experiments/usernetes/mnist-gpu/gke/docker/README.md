# Docker

Note that for this build I retrieved the data from the "latest" (2 years old) image, and pushed it to an artifact on a GPU machine to pull down to my CPU machine, and then could build the container here with the data. Figuring out the format (organization) was hard because I went down the wrong path of not realizing that it also checks the content digests, and I had the data in the correct organization:

```console
data/
└── FashionMNIST
    └── raw
        ├── t10k-images-idx3-ubyte
        ├── t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
        ├── t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte
        ├── t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
        ├── train-images-idx3-ubyte
        ├── train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
        ├── train-labels-idx1-ubyte
        └── train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
```

but the content digests were wrong. To test this, I shelled into the container, unzipped the python egg, found the source code for mnist.py, and realized what it was doing. Then I just needed to update to use latest for this build:

Instead of what I originally tested with, an older tag.

The container build here matches the data to the version of the software.

```console
docker build -t ghcr.io/converged-computing/pytorch-mnist:fashion-gke .
docker push ghcr.io/converged-computing/pytorch-mnist:fashion-gke
```

The reason we want to have the data already in the container is to avoid time it takes to download it (or errors, as I ran into).
